### New features

- Untyped serialisation supports async enumerable, thanks to @flambert860 in #566.

### Improvements

- For Windows, run unit tests on x86 and x32 explicitly.
- Improved GHA build/release process, combining all workflows into one and simplifying it, most importantly release management.

### Floor

- application slimmed down a bit, removing "File Explorer". Sticking to doing one thing and do it well - view Parquet files.
- Due to Avalonia startup times being not satisfactory when you are in the "mode" (1-2 seconds) Floor will reuse existing instance to open a file rather than starting the app again.

### Announcements 🎉

There is a new, very young project I've been thinking a lot for a long time and finally started - [DeltaIO](https://github.com/aloneguid/delta). It's attempting to do what Parquet.Net did for Apache Parquet but for Delta tables. It heavily relies on this library to read delta logs and data from it. It's still very young, but if you are interested in Delta with .NET, please check it out, bookmark, start and leave feedbacks/suggestions.
