# Improvements

- Class-reflected schemas for `map` complex types will generate key/value properties with "key" and "value" names, respectively. This is required in order to deserialise externally generated parquet files with dictionaries.
- Updated dependent packages.
- Class deserializer will check for type compatibility when deserialising incompatible types, which will prevent accidental data loss or narrowing. Thanks to @dkotov in #573.
- Write RowGroup total size and compressed size by @justinas-marozas in #580.
- DELTA_BYTE_ARRAY aka "Delta Strings" encoding can read byte array types in addition to string types.

# Bug fixes

- Adopted to breaking change in Parquet specification (technically it's a fault of upstream, not this library's) resulting in bugs like #576 and #579.
- Boolean fields encoded in RLE failed to read at all. Technically RLE can be used for integer and booleans, but we only ever supported integers.

# Changes

- Removed .NET 6 build target as it is [out of support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-6-end-of-support/).

# Floor

- Compiled using .NET 9 (upgrade from .NET 8).
