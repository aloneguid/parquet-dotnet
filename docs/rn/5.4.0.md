## Improvements
- Added `IAsyncEnumerable` serializer with `System.Linq.AsyncEnumerable`, by @Arithmomaniac in #674.
- All the documentation has been consdensed and moved back to README file, making it easier to find and read, by @aloneguid.

## Bugs fixed
- When encoding `bool` values, the results are now consistent, by @Kevin-Ross-ECC in #643.
- `ParquetRowGroupWriter.Dispose()` will not throw exceptions as it conflicts with `try/catch/finally` ideology. You should call `CompleteValidate` after writing all columns instead. Thanks to @rkarim-nnk in #666.
- Required struct members were always annotated as optional, by @aloneguid in #582.
