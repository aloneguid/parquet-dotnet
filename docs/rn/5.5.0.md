# Improvements

- `TimeSpanDataField` constructor has an option to set `IsAdjustedToUTC` (#650).
- `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` is limited to .NET 10 and above now.
- Internally, compression/decompression logic has been changed to use managed external packages for Snappy and Zstandard algorithms. IronCompress dependency is now completely removed, because there are decent managed implementations available nowadays. This will also allow to upgrade compression libraries more easily in the future and optimise memory usage. There is a slight memory usage improvement (~5%).
