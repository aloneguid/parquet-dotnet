# Parquet Floor

**Floor** is a reference implementation of the desktop application to view Parquet files. It was created as a demonstration of what is possible with Parquet.Net library, and as a visual validator of parquet files for visual thinkers.

It is not a competitor to any other parquet viewers out there, quite possibly outshining Floor in terms of features and performance. However, it is a good starting point for anyone who wants to create their own parquet viewer.
