# DataFrame Support

Since v4.8 support for [`Microsoft.Data.Analysis`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.Analysis) was added. 

This is an early draft and you are welcome to create issues/discussions around it.

## What's Supported?

Due to `DataFrame` being in general less functional than Parquet, only primitive (atomic) columns are supported at the moment. If DataFrame supports more functionality in future, this integration can be extended.
