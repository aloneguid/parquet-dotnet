## 4.16.0

### New

- Markdown documentation fully migrated to [GitHub Pages](https://aloneguid.github.io/parquet-dotnet/). It was becoming slightly unmanageable and also recent GitHub updates made markdown files look awful. Also I kind of wanted to try [Writerside by JetBrains](https://lp.jetbrains.com/writerside/), and publish docs with pride ;) @aloneguid
- Class deserializer will now skip class properties and not throw an exception if they are missing in the source parquet file. Thanks to @greenlynx in #361.
- Column statistics can be read with zero cost without reading the data. Thanks to @mirosuav in #252, #368. 

### Improvements

- IronCompress was updated to v1.5.1 by @aloneguid.

### Fixes

- Fix precision issues writing `DateTime` as milliseconds by @spanglerco in #312.
- In `DataColumnWriter`, `RecycableMemoryStream` wasn't used in a particular case, and instead `MemoryStream` was initialized directly. Thanks to @itayfisz in #373.

## 4.15.0

### Bugs Fixed

- strings **must** be null by default (#360). Thanks @waf!

### New Stuff

- You can force optionality of a schema field using the `[ParquetRequired]` attribute.
- `ParquetSerializer` validates class schema against actual file schema on deserialization and throws a helpful exception, like `System.IO.InvalidDataException : property 'Id' is declared as Id (System.String?) but source data has it as Id (System.String)` (you can spot the difference in nullability here).

## 4.14.0

- Added support for reading legacy array primitives collection serialized via legacy `ParquetConvert` class or some other legacy system, thanks to @PablitoCBR. This work was effectively taken [from his PR](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet/pull/351) and integrated more natively into this library. Thank you very much!

- Fixed deserializing parquet generated by Azure Data Explorer non-native writer by @mcbos in #357.

- re-worked build pipeline to separate build and release stage.
- use handcrafted release notes file and cut out last version notes with `grep`/`head`/`tail` on release. This is in order to improve release notes experience as autogenerated ones are often of sub-par quality.

## 4.13.0

- Add support for deserializing required strings by [@mcbos](https://github.com/mcbos) in [#341](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet/pull/341)
- Add support to .NET 6 TimeOnly type by [@ramon-garcia](https://github.com/ramon-garcia) in [#352](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet/pull/352)
- Support for reading and writing column chunk metadata by [@aloneguid](https://github.com/aloneguid) in [#354](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet/pull/354)
