## 4.14.0

- Added support for reading legacy array primitives collection serialized via legacy `ParquetConvert` class or some other legacy system, thanks to [@PablitoCBR](https://github.com/PablitoCBR). This work was effectively taken [from his PR](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet/pull/351) and integrated more natively into this library. Thank you very much!

- Fixed deserializing parquet generated by Azure Data Explorer non-native writer by [@mcbos](https://github.com/mcbos) in #357.

- re-worked build pipeline to separate build and release stage.
- use handcrafted release notes file and cut out last version notes with `grep`/`head`/`tail` on release. This is in order to improve release notes experience as autogenerated ones are often of sub-par quality.
