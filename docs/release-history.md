## 4.16.0

### New

- Markdown documentation fully migrated to GitHub Pages. It was becoming slightly unmanageable and also recent GitHub updates made markdown files look awful.

## 4.15.0

### Bugs Fixed

- strings **must** be null by default (#360). Thanks @waf!

### New Stuff

- You can force optionality of a schema field using the `[ParquetRequired]` attribute.
- `ParquetSerializer` validates class schema against actual file schema on deserialization and throws a helpful exception, like `System.IO.InvalidDataException : property 'Id' is declared as Id (System.String?) but source data has it as Id (System.String)` (you can spot the difference in nullability here).

## 4.14.0

- Added support for reading legacy array primitives collection serialized via legacy `ParquetConvert` class or some other legacy system, thanks to @PablitoCBR. This work was effectively taken [from his PR](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet/pull/351) and integrated more natively into this library. Thank you very much!

- Fixed deserializing parquet generated by Azure Data Explorer non-native writer by @mcbos in #357.

- re-worked build pipeline to separate build and release stage.
- use handcrafted release notes file and cut out last version notes with `grep`/`head`/`tail` on release. This is in order to improve release notes experience as autogenerated ones are often of sub-par quality.
