<!-- Important! Once your PR is merged, CI/CD pipeline will publish a pre-release package to the following nuget feed: https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/aloneguid/AllPublic/_packaging/parquet/nuget/v3/index.json. You can then reference the pre-release package immediately from your .NET programs. Releases to nuget.org are made when pre-release packages are validated and stable. -->
